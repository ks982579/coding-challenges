## Day 6: Wait For It

The ferry brings you across the island and you ask around about the sand. You see a poster about boat races and an all expenses paid trip toe **Desert Island**. The race is more like, you have a set time and whomever's boat travels the furthest wins. 

### Part 1

Your puzzle input is a paper that lists the time allowed for each race and the best _distance_ ever recorded in the race. To win, you need to go further than the current record holder. 

You have toy boats, hold the button on top to charge the boat and release the button to let her fly! Charging the boat increases speed one millimeter per millisecond. If you are given 7 milliseconds, and you hold the button down for 2, it will travel 2 millimeters per millisecond for the remaining 5 seconds. Apparently instantaneous acceleration. 

Your goal is to view you _margin of error_ for winning. Determine the number of ways you can beat the best record, holding button for 4, 5, 6 etc... Your answer should be the product of _the number of_ ways. So if the race can win with a button held for 2 seconds or 3 seconds, that is two ways. Then, multiply that 2 by the number of ways for the next.

### Part 2

So, [Kerning | Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning) is the process of adjusting the spacing between characters for a visually _pleasing_ result. 

The paper you were give had bad **kerning**. How bad? Really bad. You thought it was several races, but it is just one race. How many ways can you win this one single race?

This wasn't nearly as rough as yesterday's madness...
