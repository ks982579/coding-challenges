# Convolutions

The 1000s series are for math related problems and the first will be implementing a convolution. I have notes on convolutions tucked away somewhere on [my website sullivansoftware.dev](https://sullivansoftware.dev/notes/maths/fourier-analysis/). I think trying to implement them in a regular programming language would be interesting.
