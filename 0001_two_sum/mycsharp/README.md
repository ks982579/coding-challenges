# C\# Implementation

Start by following the docs!
[Hello World](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/get-started) is a good start.

```bash
dotnet new console -o mycsharp
cd mycsharp
dotnet run
```

This creates a file that uses the top-level statement method.
I will switch for the more explicit entrypoint syntax for now.
