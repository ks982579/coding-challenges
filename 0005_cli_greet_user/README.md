# CLI Greet User

This shouldn't be too tough but can be a good starting point in any language. The program must do the following:
1. Ask for the user's name
2. Ask for the user's date of birth
3. Return to the user a greeting with their name and how old they are

Make sure the spacing around the name looks good. Also, user's are prone to mistakes. Check that the birthdate makes sense. They shouldn't end up being negative years old. And they shouldn't be probably over 120 years old. If there are mistakes in the name (not provided) or in the birthday, loop and ask again. Or suggest a way to quit.
