# Height Balanced Binary Tree

Can be found on LeetCode, but as "Balanced Binary Tree".

Our definition of **height-balanced** is a binary tree such that the height of any two leaves does not differ by more than one.

Our goal is to determine if a binary tree is height balanced.

Examples help:

```txt
  2
 /\
3  5
   / \
   4  6
       \
        7
```

Without the 7, this would be OK.
However, the 7 is 2 levels below the 3, so it isn't balanced.
