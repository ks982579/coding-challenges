# Sense Palindrome

title: Palindrome Number
difficulty: easy
```

A word is a **palindrome** if it reads the same forwards as it does backwards. We want a function (or method) that can sense if a word is a palindrome.

Then, maybe to extend functionality, can we also do numbers? That might be quite easy.
