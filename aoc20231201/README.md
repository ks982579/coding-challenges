So, there's an elf who made a little mess of some calculations. There are answers that are embedded in strings. To extract the correct value, pull the first and last digit, in that order, to form a single two-digit number. 

Examples:

```json
{
  1abc2 = 12,
  pqr3stu8vwx = 38,
  a1b2c3d4e5f = 15,
  treb7uchet = 77
}
```

You'll be given your strings and need to submit the sum of all calibration values.
