# Fizz Buzz

[Fizz Buzz | HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fizzbuzz/problem).

This is a classic warm-up problem, so I found instructions on HackerRank.

Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

- For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

I think the instructions are laid out in a good order to do things as well.
