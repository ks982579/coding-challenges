# Binary Search

This can be found on LeetCode.

Given an array of integers `nums`, which is sorted in ascending order,
and an integer `target`, write a function to search for the target in the array.
If `target` exists, return its index. Else, return `-1`.

The idea is to write an algorithm with `O(log(n))` runtime complexity.
