# Advent of Code 2023

## Day 11

You come to an observatory with an elf inside. They are studying cosmic expansion. He will take you to the springs to discuss the missing parts if you help with today's observation analysis.

### Part I

Image data has been compiled into '.' representing empty spaces and the '#' representing a galaxy. 

```
...#......
.......#..
#.........
..........
......#...
.#........

```

The researcher needs to find the sum of the _shortest_ distances between every pair of galaxies. But the universe has been expanding. The time the light took to reach the observatory, it has expanded. Any row or column that contains no galaxies should all actually be twice as big. 

From the text above, it expands like the below numbered image (text). The shortest path is very... blocky. 

```
....1........

```

From Galaxy 5 to 9, there are 9 steps. In our example here, the sum of shortest paths of all 36 pairs is... 374.
