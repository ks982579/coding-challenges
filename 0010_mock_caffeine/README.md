# Mock Caffeine

There's an app out there called "caffeine" that keeps your computer awake. If you do a little reading, it signals a key input every 59 minutes. This is our goal, but with more style. One key is easy, but we should really type something like "Hello, world!". But we shouldn't be lazy, lets clean it up when we are done. 

Wait a few seconds...

And do it all over again.

Oh yeah, and try to implement this with only standard libraries. Python, for example, has many 3rd party libraries such as `pyautogui` or `pynput`, or even `pygame`, that can implement this too easily.
