# Invert a Binary Tree

This question can be found on LeetCode.

We want to invert a binary tree, and return the root.
Probably easiest with a diagram:

```text
    4               4
   / \             / \
  2   7    ->    7     2
 /\   /\        / \   / \
1  3 6  9      9   6  3  1
```

Looks like just swapping leaves / leaf nodes.
