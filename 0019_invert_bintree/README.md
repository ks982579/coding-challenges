# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

This is on Leetcode.

Suppose you are given a list of stock prices where the ith element is the price on the ith day.
The goal is to maximize profits by choosing one day to buy and another to sell, in the future.

This reminds me of an algorithm from my Algorithmics course.
I think it is the "Kadane's Algorithm"?
But that is the maximum subarray sum, so no, not the same...
