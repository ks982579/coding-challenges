# CLI Maths Game

This is an idea I've had for a little while now. I think the idea could be extended to a full-stack web or desktop application, or even a mobile app. 

This might involve concurrency if we introduce a timer. 

It's a math game, where the CL will give a question and the user provides the answer. Maybe pass in what operations they want to perform, like adding and multiplication. I was also thinking increasing the numbers after 3 right and removing one if user gets answer wrong, to keep the pot small. Never less than 10 numbers or something.
