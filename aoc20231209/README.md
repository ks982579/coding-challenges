# Advent of Code 2023

## Day 9

You have followed your map to the spot and the sandstorm subsides. You see now an _oasis_. Lucky dog. You notice above you another floating island, this one has lots of metal sticking out of it. Must be where the parts to fix the sand machines come from. 

You find a hang glider partially buried in the sand and get an idea. When the sun rises and heats the sand, the hot air might take you up to **Metal Island**. 

### Part I

While you wait, you pull out your _Oasis and Sand Instability Sensor_ (OASIS)... must have been on a camel. It analyzes your surroundings and give a report of many values and how they change over time. Each line contains the history of a single value.
