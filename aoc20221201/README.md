## Day 1: Calorie Counting

### Part 1

There's a list of items and their Calories. The list is structured such that blank lines separate what elves are carrying. 

```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000
```

That list is 3 elves carrying various foods. If an elf is hungry, the need to go to the elf with the most calories. You are given the list and you must find the total calories of the elf carrying the highest number of calories.
