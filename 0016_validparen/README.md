# Valid Parentheses

You are given a string of only '(){}[]' and must determine if it is valid.

Criteria of valid string:

1. Open brackets are also closed.
2. Open brackets are closed in correct order.
3. Every close bracket has corresponding open bracket of same type.

There are probably a few different ways to solve this.
Reminds me a bit of a Turing Machine, or Pushdown Automata.
Probably easiest to implement a stack actually, LIFO.
